# Yellow Class

This Flutter Application is made on **Windows OS** thus Firebase connection with IOS using cocoapod **was NOT feasible** as a MacOS is required for it.
The existing solutions for installing cocoapod on windows did not work (tried all existing solutions and workarounds).

Authentication only works with **Android Mobile / Android TV**

### For Android / Android TV version

Pre-made **FireBaseAuth credentials**:</br>
Username: abcd@gmail.com</br>
password: 123456

OR

Use the SIGNUP feature to make a new account.

### For IOS version

**Hardcoded credentials**:</br>
Username: ios</br>
password: 123</br>
