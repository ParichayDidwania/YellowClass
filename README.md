# Yellow Class

This Flutter Application is made on **Windows OS** thus Firebase connection with IOS using cocoapod **was NOT feasible** as a MacOS is required for it.
The existing solutions for installing cocoapod on windows did not work (tried all existing solutions and workarounds).

Authentication only works with **Android Mobile / Android TV**
